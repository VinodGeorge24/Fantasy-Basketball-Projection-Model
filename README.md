# Fantasy-Basketball-Projection-Model
## Overview
This project is an NBA Fantasy Projection Model developed using Jupyter Notebook and Python. The model is designed to predict NBA players' fantasy statistics for the upcoming season, utilizing data from various sources and implementing statistical analysis and visualization techniques.

## Features
Data Integration: Utilizes the NBA Stats API to fetch real-time player data.
Data Handling: Processes and manipulates large datasets using NumPy and Pandas.
Projections: Calculates projected fantasy statistics for players based on historical data.
Visualization: Generates dynamic bar graphs and pie charts using Matplotlib, providing a clear view of player projections.
Data Sources: Imports and analyzes data from Excel/CSV files.

## Usage
Data Input:
Load player data from Excel/CSV files.
Use the NBA Stats API to pull the latest player statistics.

Run Projections:
The model processes the input data and calculates projections for fantasy statistics, such as points, assists, rebounds, and more, outputs data within another CSV file

## Dependencies
Python 3.7+
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib

Currently working on the output side, either deciding between Matplotlib, Seaborn, or another library to give a cleaner output to the model
